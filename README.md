# Code-Refactor-Challenge
This aim of this project was to build on top of the existing landing page and code for Horiseon, I took on this challenge to build a more accessible webpage for those who may have a disablilty and aid them whilst they use this site. 

My motivation in undertaking this project was to help those who may have a disability and create website that all are able to use to it's full potential.

The problem I aimed to solve with this project was to ensure that everyone is able to access and use the site in the way that they prefer. 

From this project, I learn't the importance of Semantic elements used in HTML and how to include 'alt' tags when images are used.
